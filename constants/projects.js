        'We were challenged to design a bachelor residence that would also accommodate a formal office area and a spacious gym located in a commercial tower in the heart of the city. The concept of this project drew on a masculine and dignified pattern. The master layout of the building allowed us to separate the residential area from the office area by designating the gym in the center. These areas are internally connected and separately accessible from the elevator lobby.',
        'We went with details that were simple, yet full of character: a combination of earth colors and high-end natural materials such as wood, marble stone, and tinted glass.'
